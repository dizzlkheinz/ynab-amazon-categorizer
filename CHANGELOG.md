## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `--include-reconciled` flag to also surface already-reconciled Amazon transactions
- Split entry accepts a pre-tax base price and auto-adds sales tax by category (`=` prefix for an exact total; rates overridable via `YNAB_DEFAULT_TAX_RATE` / `YNAB_GROCERY_TAX_RATE`)
- `YNAB_SKIP_SPLIT_PROMPT_SINGLE_ITEM` env flag to skip the split prompt for single-item transactions
- Category selection now needs two consecutive blank Enters to cancel, instead of one
- Transactions with no matching parsed order are auto-skipped (with a run-end summary) instead of prompting blind
- `Ctrl+C` now exits cleanly instead of an uncaught traceback

### Fixed

- Quantity-badge items now expand to one entry per unit instead of collapsing to a single item
- Near-duplicate item lines (reworded alt-text/title pairs) are deduped by token overlap instead of exact/prefix matching
- Single-word variants of the same listing (e.g. "Black" vs "White") are kept as separate items instead of being merged as duplicates
- Markdown-link-wrapped order copies now parse correctly
- Recommendation carousels and footer nav after real order content are fully trimmed, not just the copyright line
- Delivery-status lines ("Your package was...") no longer misidentified as items
- `skip_words`/product-signal matching uses word boundaries, so "cart"/"prime" no longer false-match inside "Carton"/"Primer", etc.
- Fixed an accidentally case-insensitive all-caps check that wrongly rejected ordinary all-letter product titles
- Cancelled-order detection is now case-insensitive
- A raw `OSError` from a YNAB API call is now caught and reported like other API errors instead of crashing the session

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Typed domain and YNAB update models, plus dedicated minimal payload builders.
- A batch dry-run smoke test and a 65% minimum coverage gate in CI.
- Digital and subscription order parsing, qualified-dollar/pound/euro totals, and day-first English order dates.
- CI now installs the built wheel in a clean environment and smoke-tests its CLI entry point.
- Focused transaction-selection and batch-processing modules extracted from the interactive CLI.

### Changed

- Interactive order matches now reject exact-amount orders more than 14 days away.
- CLI and package descriptions now reflect guided categorization rather than automatic category suggestions.
- `.env` discovery is limited to the current working directory instead of silently searching parent directories.

### Fixed

- Batch enrichment now preserves existing memo text, remains idempotent, and skips updates that would truncate user content.
- Transaction updates no longer resend unrelated date, amount, payee, category, clearing, flag, or import fields from stale snapshots.
- Invalid or structurally unexpected YNAB responses now raise a typed API response error instead of crashing or appearing as empty data.
- YNAB transaction collections now validate required IDs, account IDs, ISO dates, milliunit amounts, and consumed optional fields before processing.
- Amazon payee detection now uses standalone merchant markers, avoiding false positives such as “Ramzi Market.”
- Ctrl+C and EOF at interactive prompts now exit cleanly with status 130 instead of exposing a traceback.
- International currency prefixes are preserved in order and transaction displays, and recommendation footers using any accepted currency no longer leak suggested products into order items.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Amazon order item extraction now stops at unparsed order-like blocks and post-pagination recommendation sections, preventing unrelated page content from leaking into YNAB memos.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- `--dry-run` flag: preview every update without sending changes to YNAB
- `--batch` flag: non-interactively auto-set memos (items + order link) for confidently matched transactions, leaving categories unchanged; combine with `--dry-run` to preview
- CI workflow running tests (Ubuntu + Windows, Python 3.12 & 3.13), lint, and type checks on every push and pull request

### Changed

- All interactive prompts now go through `prompt_toolkit` for consistent input handling (replaces the builtin `input()`)

### Fixed

- A matched Amazon order is no longer reused for multiple same-amount transactions in a single run
- "Subscribe & Save" / delivery-management lines and refund-status lines are no longer extracted as order items

## [2.2.4] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- Order totals with thousands separators (e.g. `$1,234.56`) are now parsed correctly
- Single-category matched orders now show all item names in the suggested memo, not just the first
- Transaction amount is displayed with the correct sign (no spurious negation)

### Changed

- Minimum supported Python version clarified to 3.12+ in README and DEVELOPMENT.md

## [2.2.3] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- Footer and nav boilerplate from the Amazon orders page (copyright lines, address blocks, credit card promos, accessibility hints) is no longer extracted as order items

## [2.2.2] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- Pin `ty==0.0.14` in dev dependencies so CI uses the same type-checker version as the lock file

## [2.2.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- Cancelled orders no longer cause their items to bleed into the preceding valid order
- Quantity badge numbers (e.g. trailing ` 2`, ` 4`) are stripped from item names when the bare form also appears, without corrupting size numbers like `Size 10`
- `"Now arriving today X:XX p.m."` delivery status lines are no longer extracted as item names

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- Comprehensive audit fixes across all modules
- Preserve Amazon order link in memo truncation when prefix space is too small

## [2.1.8] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- Ruff formatting compliance for CI

## [2.1.7] - 2026-02-04

### Changed

- Extracted testable functions from `cli.py` for better modularity
- Added retry logic to YNAB API client (3 retries with backoff on 429/5xx)
- Added stdlib logging throughout the codebase

### Added

- Comprehensive test suite for extracted CLI functions
